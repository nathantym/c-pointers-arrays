# c-pointers-arrays
Playing around with shell scripts and basic C pointers, memory, and arrays.

<b>Build Script</b>

Compiles and runs a problem/file:
```
./build.sh 1 
```

<b>Problem 1</b>
```
Define an int* pointer variable, and create an array of 10 integers using malloc().  
Then, assign values to that array, print their values, and free() the integers.
```

<b>Problem 2</b>
```
Using malloc, create a char** pointer that contains 10 char*'s, then in a loop, 
initialize each of the 10 char*'s in a loop to a char array of size 15, and initialize 
each to a word of your choice (don't forget the null terminator \0) -- and print them to 
screen.
```

<b>Problem 3</b>
```
Write a function sort() that takes in an int* a and int size, and sorts the array using 
pointer arithmetic.
```
